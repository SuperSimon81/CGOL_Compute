# cgol_compute
 Conways Game Of Life using Compute shaders. Running entirely on the GPU. Pingponging between two texures A and B. On even frames the compute shader reads from A and writes to B, displaying B. On odd frames vice versa. Code is largely uncommented, no support will be provided, use as is.
